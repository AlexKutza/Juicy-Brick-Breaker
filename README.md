# Juicy Brick Breaker

MSCH-C220 Project 3

This is a brick breaker with added "juicy" features. It has a neon 80s vaporwave aesthetic, with glowing colored sprites, retro shaders, and electronic sound effects. There are powerups, three levels, and changing game states like "fever" mode.

## Implementation

- Made origional sprite artwork for background, bricks, ball, paddle, and particles
- Bricks rotate and fall of screen when hit
- Bricks sway and wiggle randomly
- Ball has a comet trail that disappears over time
- Ball wobbles and distorts when hits something
- Particles are produced when paddle and brick are hit
- Ball bounces around on main menu screen
- Customized buttons and fonts
- Screen shakes when ball falls off screen
- Origional sound effects for hitting paddle, wall, brick, and falling off screen
- Origional music
- VHS and CRT monitor effect shader (made many tweaks)
- Colorful shader flashes during fever mode

## Future Development
I would like to play around with level design more so that difficulty progressively increases. I found that the second level was easier compared to the first. I would also like to implement alternative ending conditions for winning versus losing. I also want to add more colors to the bricks and flashes of color during powerups.
